# Github Profile Viewer

A Project Challenge by [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/) to practice frontend skills. In this [Github Profile](https://devchallenges.io/challenge/github-profile) challenge the task is to use github api to showcase profile data. I created this project in react, I strenghten my skills in data fetching using useEffect hook.

## challenges

1. The first challenge is to decide where to call API, without re-rendering other components.
2. Second major challenge that I faced is to set different states across api calls, But I managed to handle this although my current code is not efficient or optimized but I am learning everyday to write more better code.
3. Not a challenge, but the most lazy task is to write CSS ðŸ˜…. It is really boring and time consuming to write style of every component, I am thinking to switch to tailwind or bootstrap from next project.

**By the way, I didn't make the project responsive, cause my main focus on practicing core react skills. Specifically useEffect hook to fetch data from api endpoints.**

## Achivements

The Biggest achievements that I am pround of is that this is my first react app in which I have used useEffect to call API without any external help (YT/ChatGPT/ or google) and also It's my first app that I have deployed to live. I am proud of myself and this challenge has boost my confidence in learning react.
